# Caesar-Cipher

Caesar cipher is one of the simplest encryption techniques. The user selects the shift amount (or key). Every letter in the message is shifted in the alphabet by the shift amount. 

This program allows the user to encrypt or decrypt a message. The program asks the user for a shift amount and a message in both scenarios. 

The programming language used for this project is Python.
